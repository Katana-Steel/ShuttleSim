Shuttle Simulator

an attempt to create a "realistic" simulator, where you get full
access to all the shuttle's systems and controlles.

The goal is to put the user in the driver seat and give total 
access to a shuttle craft. And in the proccess learn to move one
such around, perhaps even at warp 1 or higher.
